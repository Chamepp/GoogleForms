# Selecting Nodes :balloon:
**XPath**  Expansion Algorithms

| Expression | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| nodename	 | Selects all nodes with the name "nodename" |
|    /	     | Selects from the root node                 |
|   //	     | Selects nodes in the document from the current node that match the selection no matter where they are |
|   .	     | Selects the current node                   |
|   ..	     | Selects the parent of the current node     |
|   @	     | Selects attributes                         |

##### In the table below we have listed some path expressions and the result of the expressions:

| Path Expression |	Result |
| --------------- | ------ |
| bookstore       |	Selects all nodes with the name "bookstore" |
| /bookstore      |	Selects the root element bookstore          |
| bookstore/book  |	Selects all book elements that are children of bookstore |
| //book          |	Selects all book elements no matter where they are in the document |
| bookstore//book |	Selects all book elements that are descendant of the bookstore element, no matter where they are under the bookstore element |
| //@lang	      | Selects all attributes that are named lang |

[!]**Note**: (If the path starts with a slash ( / ) it always represents an absolute path to an element !)


# What the Heck is XPATH ? :rainbow:
**XPath**  uses *path expressions* to select nodes in an XML document. The node is selected by following a path or steps. The most useful path expressions are listed below

# Finding XPATH :bulb:
**XPath** of Elements are available by using F12 on the live webpage by entering <br>
the chrome developer console and select xpath by copy selections
